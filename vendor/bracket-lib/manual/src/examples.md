# Using the Examples

Each of the `bracket-lib` crates comes with a number of examples. These are a great source of inspiration for how the parts of the library fit together, as well as serving as a demonstration of what can be done.

You can run examples locally by changing directory to the crate you wish to use (e.g. `cd bracket-terminal`), and then running `cargo run --example (name)`. You can get a list of valid example names by omitting `(name)`.

> Many people find they learn better by reading examples, rather than big manuals. If so, this section is for you!
